I"¨<p>We have developed an automatic VAT quantification technology using an innovative technique for the segmentation of CT images in the abdominal region. The software captures CT images as an input and then automatically segments the existing VAT as well as the Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT). We were granted a patent in Colombia, Japan, USA, and Europe. For more information, please access patent No.WO/2015/172753.</p>
