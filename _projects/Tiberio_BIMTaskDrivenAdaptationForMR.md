title: BIM-based mixed reality applications to improve human decision-making during the construction process

description: This PhD thesis project has for focus to propose mixed reality applications to improve human decision-making during the construction process, in particular during the pre-construction and construction phases. More precisly, we have yet designed 2 applications, one for construction supervision with drones and one for clash review during coordination design review.
