I"ï<p>In this project we analyze visitor‚Äôs behavior in an interactive virtual museum, and how it differentiates depending on the exploration environment. In order to achieve this, a tool with instances for a head-mounted display (Oculus Quest) and a conventional device (Web browser) will be made, using 3D models of archaeological artifacts from the Luis Ra√∫l Rodr√≠guez Lamus Collection - Uniandes.</p>
